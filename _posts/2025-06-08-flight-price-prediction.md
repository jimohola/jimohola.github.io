This web app predicts flight ticket prices using Indian airline data and a trained machine learning model.

### 🔍 Features
- Developed using **Python** and **Flask**
- Interactive form for user inputs (airline, route, stops, date/time)
- Predicts prices based on trained **Random Forest model**
- Trained on Indian flight fare dataset from Kaggle
- Deployed using **Render** (free tier)

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML deployment with a focus on real-world prediction use cases.
